            &quot;I have been landscaping for four years, which stemmed from my
            love of gardening. As a personal gardener, I look for individuals
            who have a variety of outdoor plants and/or large gardens that they
            would like to have serviced year round. I am here to help those who
            do not want to have to think twice about how to care for a plant and
            want to enjoy their outdoor space, rather than work to maintain it.
            I have experience maintaining gardens, lawns, privacy hedges, and
            trees. Though, there is nothing I enjoy more than maintaining a
            vegetable garden throughout the year, so clients can enjoy fresh
            produce from their own backyard, no matter the season. I look
            forward to sharing my knowledge with my clients and educating them
            on how we can work with nature, rather than against it. Let&apos;s
            help the world, the pollinators, and the microbes in your soil, to
            improve the view you see everyday. &quot;
